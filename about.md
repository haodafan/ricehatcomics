# About the Comic

I make dumb comics about my waterloo life, my programming struggles, being asian, and anything else I can make a punchline out of. I mainly use the pencil tool in MS paint as it is the peak of artistic expression.

# About the Author

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I like game design, history, and drawing stick figures. I aspire to be someone who is famous among a niche group of people, enough that I get an ego boost every once in a while, but not so famous that I need to start worrying about my own privacy.
